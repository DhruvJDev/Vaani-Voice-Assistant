   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   python main.py
   ```

### 🍎 macOS

1. **Clone the repository:**

## 🔥 Firebase Setup (Optional)

The app can fetch application mappings from Firebase for the "open app" feature. Firebase setup is **completely optional** - the app works without it.

- **With Firebase:** Users who clone the repo can use the public read-only Firebase database (no setup required)
- **Without Firebase:** You can set up your own Firebase project following [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md)

The app automatically handles Firebase connectivity and continues working regardless of Firebase status.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Windows
- **PyAudio fails to install**: Download wheel from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) for older Python versions
- **Microphone not detected**: Check **Settings > Privacy > Microphone** permissions

### macOS
- **PyAudio fails**: Ensure Homebrew and PortAudio are installed: `brew install portaudio`
- **Voice not working**: Reset voice settings: `defaults delete com.apple.speech.voice.prefs` then reboot
- **Microphone access**: Grant permission in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone**
- **Apps won't open**: Use exact app names as they appear in Applications folder (case-sensitive)

### Linux
- **No voice output**: Install espeak: `sudo apt install espeak`
- **PyAudio issues**: Install dependencies: `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`
